# Fake News Detection with Machine Learning 

This repository contains a machine learning-based solution for detecting fake news. The project aims to combat the spread of misinformation by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

# About
Fake News Detection in Machine Learning is a project developed to identify and classify news articles as either reliable or fake. The project utilizes a combination of NLP techniques, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate classification. 

# Data
The dataset used for training and evaluating the models is not included in this repository due to its size and licensing restrictions. However, you can find publicly available datasets from reliable sources such as Kaggle and Fake News Challenge to train your own models.
